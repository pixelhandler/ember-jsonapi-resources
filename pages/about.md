## About

This is a simple solution for an Ember app that utilizes resources following
the JSON API 1.0 specification. It operates on the idea that the objects in the
app (resource/model, adapter, serializer, services) simply follow the spec.

URL's are first class in the JSON API 1.0 specification and first class
in the [Ember.js] Router. Why not make them first class in your persistence
solution too?

The [JSON API] specification defines relationships including `links` objects that
providing URLs for `related` and `self`, making your API server discoverable.

This implementation takes the posture that your application's resources do not
need a complex abstraction but a simple implemenation of a solid specification.
So, this project is great for getting started with using the JSON API spec in your
Ember.js app.

Also, managing a distributed cache requires flexibility. When a client application
receives a representation of a resource from a server, the client should be able
to expire that cached object (in the browser application) based on the response
headers; or by whatever means the developer chooses.


## Status

This addon's current release is 1.4.x. The Travis build suports Ember
versions from 1.13.x though the current release, 2.8.x


## Requirements

This data persistence solution for an Ember.js application is a simple approach;
however, there are a few things you'll need to understand in order to get up
and running.

* Familiarity with [Ember.js], [Ember CLI] and [JSON API]
* You must use Ember CLI to use ember-jsonapi-resources, it's an addon
  * You'll need to uninstall Ember Data from the generated application
    and configure your app, see the 'usage' section below.
* Uses [Fetch API] see [Introduction to fetch()] and falls back to XMLHttpRequest
  * A `fetch` polyfill is included with this addon
  * A `FetchMixin` provides an option to `useAjax` if you choose
