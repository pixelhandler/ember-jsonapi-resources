      <h3>Is this a replacement for Ember Data or an interface to it?</h3>

      <p><strong>Neither</strong>. This is a completely separate solution. Ember Data needs <em>foreign keys</em> 
      and provides an abstraction for adaters and serializers. It's solution helps you work 
      with various JSON document formats. Ember JSON API Resources needs <em>URLs</em> and fits
      a specific specification for an API server without the need for an abstraction.</p>

      <h3>Does this implement all of the JSON API specification?</h3>

      <p><strong>Most of it</strong>. The happy path for reading, creating, updating/patching, deleting
      is ready, as well as patching relationships. No extension support has been worked
      on, e.g. <a href="http://jsonpatch.com/">JSON Patch</a>. I would like to do that one day.</p>

      <h3>Is this lightweight? Relative to what?</h3>

      <p><strong>Yes</strong>. With a server that follows the JSON API specification - it just works.
      This is a simple solution compared with starting from scratch using AJAX. This
      solution provides a basic, (timed) caching solution to minimize requests, and
      leaves a more advanced caching strategy to the developer via a mixin. It does
      provide a <code>store</code> object that caches deserialized resources.</p>

      <h3>Are included resources supported (side-loading)?</h3>

      <p><strong>Yes</strong>. When using <code>?include=relation</code> in a request for a resource, the (related)
      included resources will be deserialized and cached using the <code>cacheDuration</code> value
      set on the resource prototype (model).</p>

      <h3>What does the `store` actually do?</h3>

      <p><strong>Caching, and it behaves as expected in the default <code>model</code> hook of a route</strong>. 

      The store service is a facade for the services for each resource.
      Calling <code>this.store.find('entity')</code> in a route's model hook will lookup the service
      for that entity and call that service's <code>find</code> method. The service is a combination
      of an adapter, cache mixin, and associated serializer for the same entity. The service
      is an extension of that adapter with a mixin for the caching strategy for that entity.
      The default <code>service-cache</code> mixin provides a basic caching plan using a time value
      for exiration, which is a property of the resource (defaults to 7 minutes).</p>
